# Manual Testing

  _Manual Testing is a type of software testing; it is the process of executing an application with the intention of finding defects by comparing the output behaviour of the application with the expected behaviour (requirements)._

## Why Software Testing?

Software testing is to point out the defects and errors that were made during the development phase.

## Why Software has defects?
1. Incorrect requirements.
2. Wrong design.
3. Poor coding.
4. Complex business logic.
5. Complex technologies.
6. Work pressure.
7. Frequent CR's (change requests).

## Benefits of Software Testing

> Software testing helps in finalising the software application against business requirements.

### Benefits:
1. Finding the defects before delivery.
2. Gains confidence in quality.
3. Prevents defects.
4. Ensures the requirements are delivered to the client.
5. To gain application knowledge or become a subject matter expert.
6. It helps to gain domain knowledge.

+ ####  Quality: 
  Software quality is nothing but delivering the product with a bug-free application on time and meeting all requirements.
+ ####  Defect/Issue:
  *"Interms of requirements"*  A defect is a deviation or mismatch of requirements.
+ ####  Error/Bug:
  *"Interms of coding logic"*  Any incorrect human action that produces a problem in the system is called an error, and an error found during the testing phase is called a bug.
+ ####  Failure:
  The deviation or mismatch identified by the end user while using the system is called a failure.

#### Project vs Product

  *A project is developed for a single customer based on their own requirements by the software company; the project will be used by the customer only.* Ex: Any banking application. 

  *A product is developed for multiple customers on a consolidated set of requirements by a software company; the product is used by various customers.* Ex: Google, Facebook.

#### Program:

  *A set of lines of code (or) set of methods (or) set of functions (or) set of instructions is called a program.*

#### Module/Component:
  *A set of programs is called a module or component.*

#### Application/Build:
  *A set of modules or components to form an executable (.exe) file is called an application or build.*

### CMMI - "Capability Maturity Model Integration" is a standard organisational model/process.
#### Levels of CMMI:
  1. Initiation.
  2. Defined.
  3. Managed.
  4. Quantitatively Managed.
  5. Optimizing.

# SDLC
*Software development life cycle is a process followed for a software project in a software organisation. It consists of a detailed plan with a description of how to develop, maintain, replace, alter, or enhance specific software.*

## Phases of SDLC :
  1. Initial.
  2. Analysis.
  3. Design.
  4. Coding.
  5. Testing.
  6. Delivery & Maintenance.

### Why SDLC ?
  > SDLC ensures success in the process of software development.
### 1. Initial : 
  Business requirements are gathered in this phase. The main focus is a kick-off meeting of the project manager and stakeholders, meeting with managers, stakeholders, and users in order to determine the requirements like:
  + Who is going to use the system ?
  + How will they use the system?
  + What data should be input into the system ?
  + What data should be output by the system ?
