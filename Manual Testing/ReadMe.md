# Manual Testing

  _Manual Testing is a type of software testing; it is the process of executing an application with the intention of finding defects by comparing the output behaviour of the application with the expected behaviour (requirements)._

## Why Software Testing?

Software testing is to point out the defects and errors that were made during the development phase.

## Why Software has defects?
1. Incorrect requirements.
2. Wrong design.
3. Poor coding.
4. Complex business logic.
5. Complex technologies.
6. Work pressure.
7. Frequent CR's (change requests).

## Benefits of Software Testing

> Software testing helps in finalising the software application against business requirements.

### Benefits:
1. Finding the defects before delivery.
2. Gains confidence in quality.
3. Prevents defects.
4. Ensures the requirements are delivered to the client.
5. To gain application knowledge or become a subject matter expert.
6. It helps to gain domain knowledge.

+ ####  Quality: 
  Software quality is nothing but delivering the product with a bug-free application on time and meeting all requirements.
+ ####  Defect/Issue:
  *"Interms of requirements"*  A defect is a deviation or mismatch of requirements.
+ ####  Error/Bug:
  *"Interms of coding logic"*  Any incorrect human action that produces a problem in the system is called an error, and an error found during the testing phase is called a bug.
+ ####  Failure:
  The deviation or mismatch identified by the end user while using the system is called a failure.
